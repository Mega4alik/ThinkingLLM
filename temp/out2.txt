First, I recognize that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. Let's denote Darrell's age as 7x and Allen's age as 11x, where x is a common multiplier.

The sum of their ages is given as 162. Therefore, I can set up the equation 7x + 11x = 162. Combining like terms gives 18x = 162. Solving for x, I find x = 9.

Now, to determine Allen's current age, I multiply x by 11, resulting in Allen's age being 99 years old.

Finally, to find Allen's age 10 years from now, I add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.
</think>

**Solution:**

We are given that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11, and their total age now is 162 years. We need to find Allen's age 10 years from now.

1. **Set Up the Ratio:**
   
   Let Darrell's age be \(7x\) and Allen's age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

2. **Express the Total Age:**
   
   The sum of their ages is:
   \[
   7x + 11x = 18x
   \]
   
   Given that the total age is 162 years:
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
   
3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   
   \[
   x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
   \]
   
4. **Find Allen's Current Age:**
   
   Allen's age is:
   \[
   11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]
   
5. **Calculate Allen's Age 10 Years from Now:**
   
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]
   
**Final Answer:**
\[

First, I need to determine how many small and large stickers Lorraine has initially. She starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.

Next, she decides to trade 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. Calculating 90% of 30 small stickers gives her 27 small stickers left.

She then trades 50% of her remaining large stickers for large buttons. With 40 large stickers, 50% is 20, leaving her with 20 large stickers.

The remaining 50% of her large stickers, which is also 20, are traded for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth three small stickers, so she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small stickers.

After the initial trade, Lorraine has 3 small stickers and 27 large stickers. She then receives 60 more small stickers, totaling 63 small stickers and 27 large stickers.

Finally, she trades 90% of her remaining small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 63 is 56.7, which we round down to 56 small stickers. This leaves her with 7 small stickers.

For the large stickers, she has 27. She trades 50% of them, which is 13.5, rounded down to 13, leaving her with 14 large stickers.

In total, Lorraine ends up with 7 small stickers and 14 large stickers, for a total of 21 buttons.

First, I need to determine the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day. Let's denote this total as \( T \).

According to the problem, the first plane spends three-quarters of its flights at Greece. This means it has \( \frac{3}{4}T \) flights there.

The remaining one-quarter of its flights, which is \( \frac{1}{4}T \), are equally split between France and Germany. Therefore, each of these destinations has \( \frac{1}{8}T \) flights.

Next, I'll consider the second plane, which flies exclusively to Poland. Its 44 trips are half the number of trips the first plane makes. This gives the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2}T = 44
\]
Solving for \( T \) yields \( T = 88 \) flights in total.

Finally, since the first plane makes \( \frac{1}{8}T \) flights to France, substituting \( T = 88 \) gives \( \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11 \) flights to France.
</think>

Let's determine how many flights to France the first plane takes in one day.

1. **Let \( T \) be the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.**

2. **Flights to Greece:**
   \[
   \frac{3}{4}T
   \]
   
3. **Remaining flights:**
   \[
   T - \frac{3}{4}T = \frac{1}{4}T
   \]
   These remaining flights are equally split between France and Germany:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}T \div 2 = \frac{1}{8}T
   \]
   Therefore, the number of flights to France is:

First, I need to determine the amount of water in the orange drink before any spillage. The orange drink is 10 liters, with two-thirds being water. Calculating this gives:

10 liters * (2/3) = 6.666... liters of water.

Next, I'll find out how much water is in the pineapple drink. The pineapple drink is 15 liters, with three-fifths being water. This calculation results in:

15 liters * (3/5) = 9 liters of water.

Now, I'll add the water from both the orange and pineapple drinks to find the total amount of water:

6.666... liters + 9 liters = 15.666... liters of water.

Since I spilled one liter of the orange drink, I need to subtract that from the total water content:

15.666... liters - 1 liter = 14.666... liters.

Finally, I'll provide the answer rounded to one decimal place.
</think>

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the amount of water remaining in the mixture after spilling one liter of orange drink.

1. **Orange Drink:**
   - **Total Volume:** 10 liters
   - **Proportion of Water:** Two-thirds (2/3)
   - **Water Content:** \(10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667\) liters

2. **Pineapple Drink:**
   - **Total Volume:** 15 liters
   - **Proportion of Water:** Three-fifths (3/5)
   - **Water Content:** \(15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9\) liters

3. **Total Water Before Spill:**
   - Add the water from both drinks:
   \[
   \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.6667 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. **After Spilling One Liter of Orange Drink:**
   - **Water Lost Due to Spill:** Since we spilled one liter of orange drink, we need to determine how much water was in that liter.
   - **Water in Spilled Orange Drink:** 
     \[
     1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - **Remaining Water:**
     \[
     15.6667 - 0.6667 = 15 \text{ liters}
