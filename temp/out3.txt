To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Ratio:**
   - The ages of Darrell and Allen are in the ratio of 7:11.
   - This means for every 7 years Darrell is old, Allen is 11 years old.

2. **Express the Ages in Terms of a Variable:**
   - Let the common multiple be \( x \).
   - Darrell's age = \( 7x \)
   - Allen's age = \( 11x \)

3. **Set Up the Equation for the Total Age:**
   - The sum of their ages is 162.
   - \( 7x + 11x = 162 \)

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Combine like terms: \( 18x = 162 \)
   - Divide both sides by 18: \( x = 9 \)

5. **Find Allen's Current Age:**
   - Allen's age = \( 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \)

6. **Calculate Allen's Age 10 Years from Now:**
   - Add 10 years to his current age: \( 99 + 10 = 109 \)

**Final Answer:** \boxed{109}  -- LABEL: d#### 109   -- gen_ids: 297

To determine how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Bethany's Laps:**
   - Bethany can run **10 laps** in one hour.

2. **Trey's Laps:**
   - Trey can run **4 more laps** than Bethany.
   - **Trey's Laps = Bethany's Laps + 4**
   - **Trey's Laps = 10 + 4 = 14 laps**

3. **Shaelyn's Laps:**
   - Shaelyn can run **half as many laps** as Trey.
   - **Shaelyn's Laps = Trey's Laps / 2**
   - **Shaelyn's Laps = 14 / 2 = 7 laps**

4. **Quinn's Laps:**
   - Quinn can run **2 fewer laps** than Shaelyn.
   - **Quinn's Laps = Shaelyn's Laps - 2**
   - **Quinn's Laps = 7 - 2 = 5 laps**

5. **Difference Between Bethany and Quinn:**
   - **Difference = Bethany's Laps - Quinn's Laps**
   - **Difference = 10 - 5 = 5 laps**

**Final Answer:** Bethany can run **5 more laps** than Quinn.  -- LABEL: nn.#### 5   -- gen_ids: 296

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the number of measuring cups:**
   - Jonathan has **2 dozen cups**.
   - 1 dozen = 12, so 2 dozen = 24 cups.
   - Total measuring cups = 24.

2. **Find the number of measuring spoons:**
   - Jonathan has **2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups**.
   - Number of measuring spoons = (2/3) × 24 = 16.

3. **Calculate the total number of utensils after receiving gifts:**
   - Jonathan receives **6 measuring spoons for his birthday**.
   - Total measuring spoons after gift = 16 + 6 = 22.
   - Total utensils = measuring cups + measuring spoons = 24 + 22 = 46.

**Problem:**  
Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. If the cat can run 15 feet/second, how many feet can her turtle crawl in 40 seconds?

**Solution:**  

1. **Determine the turtle's speed:**  
   The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.  
   \[
   \text{Cat's speed} = 5 \times \text{Turtle's speed}
   \]  
   Given the cat's speed is 15 feet/second:  
   \[
   15 = 5 \times \text{Turtle's speed}
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance the turtle crawls in 40 seconds:**  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ feet}
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
The turtle can crawl \(\boxed{120}\) feet in 40 seconds.  -- LABEL: t#### 120   -- gen_ids: 268

**Solution:**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) be the total number of flights the first plane makes in a day.
   - The second plane flies exclusively to Poland and makes 44 trips.

2. **Flights of the First Plane:**
   - The first plane flies to Greece for three-quarters of its flights: \( \frac{3}{4}F \).
   - The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany:
     - To France: \( \frac{1}{2} \times \left(F - \frac{3}{4}F\right) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4}F = \frac{1}{8}F \).
     - To Germany: Similarly, \( \frac{1}{8}F \).

3. **Flights of the Second Plane:**
   - The second plane flies to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of flights the first plane makes:
     \[
     44 = \frac{1}{2}F \implies F = 88
     \]

4. **Flights to France:**
   - From step 2, the flights to France are \( \frac{1}{8}F \).
   - Substituting \( F = 88 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
     \]

**Answer:** The first plane takes **11 flights to France** in one day.  -- LABEL: y.#### 11   -- gen_ids: 340

To determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixture, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the water in the orange drink:**
   - Total orange drink: 10 liters
   - Fraction that is water: \( \frac{2}{3} \)
   - Water in orange drink: \( 10 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{20}{3} \) liters

2. **Calculate the water in the pineapple drink:**
   - Total pineapple drink: 15 liters
   - Fraction that is water: \( \frac{3}{5} \)
   - Water in pineapple drink: \( 15 \times \frac{3}{5} = 9 \) liters

3. **Total water in the mixture before spilling:**
   - Total water: \( \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \) liters

4. **Adjust for the spilled orange drink:**
   - Orange drink spilled: 1 liter
   - Water in spilled orange drink: \( 1 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \) liters
   - Remaining water in orange drink: \( \frac{20}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) liters

5. **Total water in the remaining mixture:**
   - Total water: \( 6 + 9 = 15 \) liters

**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{15}\) liters  -- LABEL: s.#### 15   -- gen_ids: 363

To determine how many movies Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks, let's break down the information step by step.

1. **Movies Watched on Saturday:**
   - They watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Movies Watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday compared to Saturday.
   - Number of movies on Sunday = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) movies.

3. **Total Movies Watched in One Weekend:**
   - Total = Saturday + Sunday = 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

4. **Total Movies Watched in 4 Weeks:**
   - Since they watch movies every weekend, the total number of movies over 4 weeks is:
   - Total = 6 movies/weekend × 4 weeks = 24 movies.
