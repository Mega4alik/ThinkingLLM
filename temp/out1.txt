To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Ratio**: The ages of Darrell and Allen are in the ratio of 7:11. This means for every 7 years Darrell is old, Allen is 11 years old.

2. **Set Up Variables**: Let Darrell's current age be \(7x\) and Allen's current age be \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier.

3. **Total Age Equation**: The sum of their ages is 162 years.
   \[
   7x + 11x = 162
   \]
   \[
   18x = 162
   \]
   \[
   x = 9
   \]

4. **Find Allen's Current Age**: Multiply \(x\) by 11.
   \[
   11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
   \]

5. **Calculate Age 10 Years from Now**: Add 10 years to Allen's current age.
   \[
   99 + 10 = 109
   \]

**Final Answer**: Allen will be 109 years old 10 years from now.  -- LABEL: d#### 109   -- gen_ids: 277

To determine how many buttons Lorraine has by the end, we'll break down her trades step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers:**
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **First Trade:**
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 × 30 = 27 small stickers.
   - Each small sticker is worth 1 small button.
   - So, she gets 27 large buttons.

3. **Second Trade:**
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 × 40 = 20 large stickers.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, which is equivalent to 3 small buttons.
   - So, she gets 20 × 3 = 60 large buttons.

4. **Third Trade:**
   - The remaining large stickers are traded for small buttons.
   - Total large stickers after first two trades: 40 - 20 = 20.
   - 20 large stickers × 3 small buttons per large sticker = 60 small buttons.

5. **Total Buttons:**
   - Large buttons received: 27 + 60 = 87 large buttons.
   - Small buttons received: 60 small buttons.
   - Total buttons = 87 + 60 = 147 buttons.

**Final Answer:** 147 buttons  -- LABEL: 89#### 89   -- gen_ids: 348

To determine how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we first need to find the turtle's speed. Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle and the cat's speed is 15 feet per second, the turtle's speed is:

\[
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15 \text{ feet/second}}{5} = 3 \text{ feet/second}
\]

Next, we calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds by multiplying its speed by the time:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ feet/second} \times 40 \text{ seconds} = 120 \text{ feet}
\]

**Answer:** The turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.  -- LABEL: t#### 120   -- gen_ids: 200
